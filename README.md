# Java-ZTM
Collection of Java exercises from the [Zero-to-Mastery academy course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/java-bootcamp/)

I felt I needed to go back to the basics and complete a thorough review of Java since I haven't used it in my previous role for over a year. Despite having tackled more advanced implementations of the language, libraries, and frameworks, there were gaps I wanted to close up. Once the course is complete I'll likely remove this repo in lieu of a repo that will contain sample projects in Java.
